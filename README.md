CSE 160: Assignment 0 - Vector Library by Daniel Rothman (DanielR007)

Project Description
This project involves creating a basic 2D vector library and a web-based visualizer. 
It implements a Vector3 class to handle vector math such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, magnitude, normalization, dot product, and cross product. 
The visualizer allows users to input coordinates, perform operations, and view the 
resulting vectors on an HTML5 canvas.
